# MaaS360_API - Node js
This is a MaaS360 API sample which requests a MaaS360 authentication token and pull the user and device data from your MaaS360 Account.


After pulling the project, type “npm install” in your terminal to use the “package.json” to download the necessary dependencies and get started.
The IPA includes a Monitoring which lists all devices without a checked in status and a simple User view. The Device view allows you to display selected device details, a list with all programs on the device and a map with the device location as well.

"body-parser": "^1.18.2"

"ejs": "^2.5.8"

"express": "^4.16.3"

"node-fetch": "^2.1.2"
